The first file is in the data folder and that includes gathering the articles from the api's
The cleaning files includes the process of taking the dats and first putting them into a large data base
then each source's articles headlinea are put into matrices which counts the word use for each headline after things like punctuation and stop words are removed.
The app then takes these matrices and creates the wordclouds which also allows users to pick which source they would like to view.
